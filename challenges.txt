Challenges:

1. Navigating through the directories to find filenames and writing an optimal function to do so.
Resolved by using recursion and adding the filenames along with absolute path to a list

2. Too much time to append the data to dataframe and dataframe append deprecation warning.
Resolved by appending the dataframes to a list and concatenating at the end

3. Python couldn't read the data from the file due to encoding issues
Resolved by adding encoding 'utf-8' while opening the file

4. Exploring the data using regular expressions
